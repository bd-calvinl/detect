# Software Composition Analysis (SCA) 

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is an automated process that identifies the open source software in a codebase. This analysis is performed to evaluate security, license compliance, and code quality by providing users with visibility into their open source code inventory. 

Software Composition Analysis as a Service (SCAaaS) provides the same functionality as SCA, but is run as a cloud hosted service whereby users do not require their own hardware to run the application(s).
